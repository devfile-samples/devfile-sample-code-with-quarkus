# Creating an application with a Quarkus code sample

**Note:** The Quarkus code sample uses the **8081** HTTP port.

Before you begin creating an application with this `devfile` code sample, it's helpful to understand the relationship between the `devfile` and `Dockerfile` and how they contribute to your build. You can find these files at the following URLs:

* [Quarkus `devfile.yaml`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/devfile.yaml)
* [Quarkus `Dockerfile`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm.staged)

1. The `devfile.yaml` file has an [`image-build` component](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/devfile.yaml#L22-L28) that points to your `Dockerfile`.
2. The [`src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm.staged`](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm.staged) file contains the instructions you need to build the code sample as a container image.
3. The `devfile.yaml` [`kubernetes-deploy` component](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/devfile.yaml#L29-L40) points to a `deploy.yaml` file that contains instructions for deploying the built container image.
4. The `devfile.yaml` [`deploy` command](https://github.com/devfile-samples/devfile-sample-code-with-quarkus/blob/main/devfile.yaml#L42-L55) completes the [outerloop](https://devfile.io/docs/2.2.0/innerloop-vs-outerloop) deployment phase by pointing to the `image-build` and `kubernetes-deploy` components to create your application.
